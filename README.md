Adrenaline is a lightweight and minimalistic application for creating targeted workout regimens.

---

Typical workout regimens or "splits" generally involve varying multiple different exercise routines throughout a periodic cycle. For example, a common split, "Push Pull Legs" (PPL) invovles rotating between a push day (ex. bench press), a pull day (ex. curls) and a leg day (ex. barbell squats). Other common splits include upper/lower and full-body.

With Adrenaline, users can design workout plans and fine-tune their splits by assessing the degree to which muscle groups are targeted by individual exercises and workouts. Adrenaline will feature a large collection of exercises which can be suggested to users looking to switch up their routines, target new muscle groups, or balance their existing splits.

## Additional Features

- Workout intensity calculator
- Muscle group heatmap visualizer
- Exercise calendar
- Strength level evaluator & tracker
  - Standards for various exercises calculated based on age, body weight, and gender

## Demos

I'm currently working hard on developing concepts and demos for this project. Stay tuned for more updates!
